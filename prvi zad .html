<h2>Brief History</h2>

<div class="about">
  <p>
    Rugby football refers to the team sports rugby league and rugby union. Rugby union originated at Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire and rugby league originated in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire after splitting to form the Northern Rugby Football Union in 1895, today called the Rugby Football League. Rugby football (both league and union) is one of many versions of football played at English public schools in the 19th century.[1]. Although rugby league initially used rugby union rules, they are now wholly separate sports. In addition to the two existing codes, both codes of gridiron football (American football and Canadian football) have evolved from rugby football, but each has key differences.

  The Greeks and Romans are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet. The Roman game harpastum is believed to have been adapted from a Greek team game known as "ἐπίσκυρος" (Episkyros)[4][5] or "φαινίνδα" (phaininda),[6] which is mentioned by a Greek playwright, Antiphanes (388–311 BC) and later referred to by the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria (c.150-c.215 AD). These games appear to have resembled rugby football.[7][8][9][10][11] The Roman politician Cicero (106–42 BC) describes the case of a man who was killed whilst having a shave when a ball was kicked into a barber's shop. Roman ball games already knew the air-filled ball, the follis.[12][13] Episkyros is recognised as an early form of football by FIFA.[14]
